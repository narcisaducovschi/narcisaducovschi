<h2> Hola! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" width="50"></h2>

I'm a second-year Web Application Development student (DAW). I have a strong interest in logical problem-solving and programming, and I enjoy writing clean, well-structured code to tackle complex challenges.

I'm also currently learning Chinese, which reflects my curiosity and passion for continuous learning
